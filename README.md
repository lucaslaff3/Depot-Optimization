# Depot-Optimization
Developing an algorithm to figure out the optimal location for Home Depot storage locations where the cost of delivery and storage is minimized. 

## Data
The file containing the simulated Home Depot demand of each location within the 3 states of Alabama, Texas and California.

## Project Started.ipynb
The jupyter notebook file containing the algorithm used to solve this problem. Through the use of K-means (yet to be implemented) and the Clarke-Wright Savings algorithm, the data will be clustered and maped to optimize the locaiton(s) of Home Depot storage locations.
